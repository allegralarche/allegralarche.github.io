    <div class="body" id="about">
        I'm a junior at UPenn majoring in Computer and Information Science
        and minoring in math/history. I also serve on Penn's Advancing Women in
        Engineering advisory board and have just been elected VP of Intellectual
        Development for my sorority, Alpha Chi Omega. </br></br>
        I'm originally from a small town (bubble) in New Jersey, so I love exploring
        the cities I've had the privelege of living in since going to college. Between
        going to school in Philly, interning in New York this past summer, and studying
        abroad in Edinburgh this fall, I've spent a lot of my free time over the
        past few years trying to see and experience as much of what these places
        have to offer as I can. I'm also an avid runner, lover of fine budget dining,
        aspiring spotify playlist curator, and (unsurprisingly enough for an engineer)
        huge Harry Potter fan.</br></br>

        <div class="work-position">The Sports Quotient: Programming Intern</div>
        <p class="work-description">This past summer I worked at a small sports media website that was looking to migrate their
            content-heavy site form wordpress to a faster and more easily customizable platform. I had never worked with Django before,
            but my coworker had some experience with it and suggested we use it for the new site. I was quickly brought up to speed, and the
            two of us worked together to completely rebuild and revamp the site from scratch over the ten weeks we worked there. In addition to
            the migration, we added a new tracking system for editors and writers in the backend to help everyone stay on top of their work, a more
            intricate quiz system, and a generally more friendly user interface for readers. I think I learned more about web development and
            design over the course of this summer than I have over the course of my entire programming career!</p>

        <div class="work-position">Internal Drive Tech Camps:Instructor</div>
        <p class="work-description">The summer after my freshman year, I worked at a camp near my home teaching kids aged 9-12 basic
            programming concepts. The course used the game of <a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> and its intricate built-in command
            block system to demonstrate concepts like logic flow and loops to the campers. The task for their final projects was to make a multi-
            stage game using the skills they learned in the course that could be played by their peers within Minecraft. This was a beyond-
            rewarding experience for me; I was constantly in awe of how much these kids were able to learn and accomplish in just one week.</p>
